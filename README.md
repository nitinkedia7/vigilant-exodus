[Kerala floods: Over 1 million in relief camps, focus on rehabilitation](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/65478086.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst)

Headlines like these clearly demonstrate the massive number of unfortunate people who have been already displaced by a calamity or must seek shelter somewhere else for they aren't in a place secure.

This is where *vigilant-exodus* comes in as a tool for promoting
accesibility to safe evacuation centers and transparency about the status of such centers.

### For whom?

1. Victims
* Check nearby relief centers with data such as current number of refugees, capacity, food and medicine supply. This will help refugees to take a more informed decision so that a balance is maintained between where there is help and where help is needed. 
* Refugees have check-in facility. They can also register as volunteer if they are able to.
* We plan to crowdsource information about obstacles, dangerous areas
and display them on a Map based dashboard to help people take safe routes to centers. 

2. Friends and family of victims:
Suppose a loved one is out of contact and possibly amidst a disaster. Friends and family create a missing person request. As soon as the person checks in any relief center, they are immediately notified, along with a video or photo.   

2. Shelter Organisers: An inventory management system, tracking evacuees ensures that resources get there where it is needed the most. Data from every center is openly visible to other centers and people. Thus different centers can coordinate their resources and rescue attempts.

### Additional Feature:

1. We are also thinking of using Sentiment Analysis in our project. Using sentiment analysis on social media posts, we will be able to recognise those people who are more inclined to help the victims and then we will use our message services to ask them to donate and help the victims. Using sentiment analysis on the social media posts of refugees in a shelter, we will be able to estimate condition of the shelter and volunteers can be asked to help those shelters.

### Technologies to be used:

* Django
* Map API, SMS API
* HTML/CSS/JS alongwith a frontend framework.
* Microsoft Azure for Cloud Services/API's.
* GitHub for version control.
